<H2><A NAME="about">About Nebula</A></H2>
<P>
Nebula is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language
developed by a
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/authors.html">team</A>
at
<A HREF="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</A>,
the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Nebula is
<A HREF="#license">free software</A>
used in
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/uses.html">many products and projects</A>
around the world.

<P>
Nebula's
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/">official web site</A>
provides complete information
about Nebula,
including
an
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/about.html">executive summary</A>
and
updated
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/docs.html">documentation</A>,
especially the
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/manual/5.4/">reference manual</A>,
which may differ slightly from the
<A HREF="contents.html">local copy</A>
distributed in this package.

<H2><A NAME="install">Installing Nebula</A></H2>
<P>
Nebula is distributed in
<A HREF="http://www.nebula.org/ftp/">source</A>
form.
You need to build it before using it.
Building Nebula should be straightforward
because
Nebula is implemented in pure ANSI C and compiles unmodified in all known
platforms that have an ANSI C compiler.
Nebula also compiles unmodified as C++.
The instructions given below for building Nebula are for Unix-like platforms,
such as Linux and Mac OS X.
See also
<A HREF="#other">instructions for other systems</A>
and
<A HREF="#customization">customization options</A>.

<P>
If you don't have the time or the inclination to compile Nebula yourself,
get a binary from
<A HREF="http://nebula-users.org/wiki/NebulaBinaries">NebulaBinaries</A>.
Try also
<A HREF="http://nebuladist.org/">NebulaDist</A>,
a multi-platform distribution of Nebula that includes batteries.

<H3>Building Nebula</H3>
<P>
In most common Unix-like platforms, simply do "<KBD>make</KBD>".
Here are the details.

<OL>
<LI>
Open a terminal window and move to
the top-level directory, which is named <TT>nebula-5.4.4</TT>.
The <TT>Makefile</TT> there controls both the build process and the installation process.
<P>
<LI>
  Do "<KBD>make</KBD>". The <TT>Makefile</TT> will guess your platform and build Nebula for it.
<P>
<LI>
  If the guess failed, do "<KBD>make help</KBD>" and see if your platform is listed.
  The platforms currently supported are:
<P>
<P CLASS="display">
   guess aix bsd c89 freebsd generic linux linux-readline macosx mingw posix solaris
</P>
<P>
  If your platform is listed, just do "<KBD>make xxx</KBD>", where xxx
  is your platform name.
<P>
  If your platform is not listed, try the closest one or posix, generic,
  c89, in this order.
<P>
<LI>
The compilation takes only a few moments
and produces three files in the <TT>src</TT> directory:
nebula (the interpreter),
nebulac (the compiler),
and libnebula.a (the library).
<P>
<LI>
  To check that Nebula has been built correctly, do "<KBD>make test</KBD>"
  after building Nebula. This will run the interpreter and print its version.
</OL>
<P>
If you're running Linux, try "<KBD>make linux-readline</KBD>" to build the interactive Nebula interpreter with handy line-editing and history capabilities.
If you get compilation errors,
make sure you have installed the <TT>readline</TT> development package
(which is probably named <TT>libreadline-dev</TT> or <TT>readline-devel</TT>).
If you get link errors after that,
then try "<KBD>make linux-readline MYLIBS=-ltermcap</KBD>".

<H3>Installing Nebula</H3>
<P>
  Once you have built Nebula, you may want to install it in an official
  place in your system. In this case, do "<KBD>make install</KBD>". The official
  place and the way to install files are defined in the <TT>Makefile</TT>. You'll
  probably need the right permissions to install files, and so may need to do "<KBD>sudo make install</KBD>".

<P>
  To build and install Nebula in one step, do "<KBD>make all install</KBD>",
  or "<KBD>make xxx install</KBD>",
  where xxx is your platform name.

<P>
  To install Nebula locally after building it, do "<KBD>make local</KBD>".
  This will create a directory <TT>install</TT> with subdirectories
  <TT>bin</TT>, <TT>include</TT>, <TT>lib</TT>, <TT>man</TT>, <TT>share</TT>,
  and install Nebula as listed below.

  To install Nebula locally, but in some other directory, do
  "<KBD>make install INSTALL_TOP=xxx</KBD>", where xxx is your chosen directory.
  The installation starts in the <TT>src</TT> and <TT>doc</TT> directories,
  so take care if <TT>INSTALL_TOP</TT> is not an absolute path.

<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
    bin:
<DD>
    nebula nebulac
<DT>
    include:
<DD>
    nebula.h nebulaconf.h nebulalib.h auxlib.h nebula.hpp
<DT>
    lib:
<DD>
    libnebula.a
<DT>
    man/man1:
<DD>
    nebula.1 nebulac.1
</DL>

<P>
  These are the only directories you need for development.
  If you only want to run Nebula programs,
  you only need the files in <TT>bin</TT> and <TT>man</TT>.
  The files in <TT>include</TT> and <TT>lib</TT> are needed for
  embedding Nebula in C or C++ programs.

<H3><A NAME="customization">Customization</A></H3>
<P>
  Three kinds of things can be customized by editing a file:
<UL>
    <LI> Where and how to install Nebula &mnebula; edit <TT>Makefile</TT>.
    <LI> How to build Nebula &mnebula; edit <TT>src/Makefile</TT>.
    <LI> Nebula features &mnebula; edit <TT>src/nebulaconf.h</TT>.
</UL>

<P>
  You don't actually need to edit the Makefiles because you may set the
  relevant variables in the command line when invoking make.
  Nevertheless, it's probably best to edit and save the Makefiles to
  record the changes you've made.

<P>
  On the other hand, if you need to customize some Nebula features, you'll need
  to edit <TT>src/nebulaconf.h</TT> before building and installing Nebula.
  The edited file will be the one installed, and
  it will be used by any Nebula clients that you build, to ensure consistency.
  Further customization is available to experts by editing the Nebula sources.

<H3><A NAME="other">Building Nebula on other systems</A></H3>
<P>
  If you're not using the usual Unix tools, then the instructions for
  building Nebula depend on the compiler you use. You'll need to create
  projects (or whatever your compiler uses) for building the library,
  the interpreter, and the compiler, as follows:

<DL CLASS="display">
<DT>
library:
<DD>
api.c code.c ctype.c debug.c do.c dump.c function.c garbageCollection.c lexer.c memory.c object.c opcodes.c parser.c state.c string.c table.c tagMethods.c undump.c virtualMachine.c zio.c
auxlib.c baselib.c corolib.c dblib.c iolib.c mathlib.c loadlib.c oslib.c strlib.c tablib.c utf8lib.c Initialize.c
<DT>
interpreter:
<DD>
  library, nebula.c
<DT>
compiler:
<DD>
  library, nebulac.c
</DL>

<P>
  To use Nebula as a library in your own programs, you'll need to know how to
  create and use libraries with your compiler. Moreover, to dynamically load
  C libraries for Nebula, you'll need to know how to create dynamic libraries
  and you'll need to make sure that the Nebula API functions are accessible to
  those dynamic libraries &mnebula; but <EM>don't</EM> link the Nebula library
  into each dynamic library. For Unix, we recommend that the Nebula library
  be linked statically into the host program and its symbols exported for
  dynamic linking; <TT>src/Makefile</TT> does this for the Nebula interpreter.
  For Windows, we recommend that the Nebula library be a DLL.
  In all cases, the compiler nebulac should be linked statically.

<P>
  As mentioned above, you may edit <TT>src/nebulaconf.h</TT> to customize
  some features before building Nebula.
