<h1>1 &nacorn; <a name="1">Introduction</a></h1>

<p>
Acorn is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.
It supports procedural programming,
object-oriented programming, functional programming,
data-driven programming, and data description.


<p>
Acorn combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description
constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics.
Acorn is dynamically typed,
runs by interpreting bytecode with a register-based
virtual machine,
and has automatic memory management with
a generational garbage collection,
making it ideal for configuration, scripting,
and rapid prototyping.


<p>
Acorn is implemented as a library, written in <em>clean C</em>,
the common subset of Standard&nbsp;C and C++.
The Acorn distribution includes a host program called <code>acorn</code>,
which uses the Acorn library to offer a complete,
standalone Acorn interpreter,
for interactive or batch use.
Acorn is intended to be used both as a powerful, lightweight,
embeddable scripting language for any program that needs one,
and as a powerful but lightweight and efficient stand-alone language.


<p>
As an extension language, Acorn has no notion of a "main" program:
it works <em>embedded</em> in a host client,
called the <em>embedding program</em> or simply the <em>host</em>.
(Frequently, this host is the stand-alone <code>acorn</code> program.)
The host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Acorn code,
can write and read Acorn variables,
and can register C&nbsp;functions to be called by Acorn code.
Through the use of C&nbsp;functions, Acorn can be augmented to cope with
a wide range of different domains,
thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.


<p>
Acorn is free software,
and is provided as usual with no guarantees,
as stated in its license.
The implementation described in this manual is available
at Acorn's official web site, <code>www.acorn.org</code>.


<p>
Like any other reference manual,
this document is dry in places.
For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Acorn,
see the technical papers available at Acorn's web site.
For a detailed introduction to programming in Acorn,
see Roberto's book, <em>Programming in Acorn</em>.



<h1>2 &nacorn; <a name="2">Basic Concepts</a></h1>



<p>
This section describes the basic concepts of the language.





<h2>2.1 &nacorn; <a name="2.1">Values and Types</a></h2>

<p>
Acorn is a dynamically typed language.
This means that
variables do not have types; only values do.
There are no type definitions in the language.
All values carry their own type.


<p>
All values in Acorn are first-class values.
This means that all values can be stored in variables,
passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.


<p>
There are eight basic types in Acorn:
<em>nil</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>number</em>,
<em>string</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>userdata</em>,
<em>thread</em>, and <em>table</em>.
The type <em>nil</em> has one single value, <b>nil</b>,
whose main property is to be different from any other value;
it often represents the absence of a useful value.
The type <em>boolean</em> has two values, <b>false</b> and <b>true</b>.
Both <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> make a condition false;
they are collectively called <em>false values</em>.
Any other value makes a condition true.
Despite its name,
<b>false</b> is frequently used as an alternative to <b>nil</b>,
with the key difference that <b>false</b> behaves
like a regular value in a table,
while a <b>nil</b> in a table represents an absent key.


<p>
The type <em>number</em> represents both
integer numbers and real (floating-point) numbers,
using two subtypes: <em>integer</em> and <em>float</em>.
Standard Acorn uses 64-bit integers and double-precision (64-bit) floats,
but you can also compile Acorn so that it
uses 32-bit integers and/or single-precision (32-bit) floats.
The option with 32 bits for both integers and floats
is particularly attractive
for small machines and embedded systems.
(See macro <code>ACORN_32BITS</code> in file <code>acornconf.h</code>.)


<p>
Unless stated otherwise,
any overflow when manipulating integer values <em>wrap around</em>,
according to the usual rules of two-complement arithmetic.
(In other words,
the actual result is the unique representable integer
that is equal modulo <em>2<sup>n</sup></em> to the mathematical result,
where <em>n</em> is the number of bits of the integer type.)


<p>
Acorn has explicit rules about when each subtype is used,
but it also converts between them automatically as needed (see <a href="#3.4.3">&sect;3.4.3</a>).
Therefore,
the programmer may choose to mostly ignore the difference
between integers and floats
or to assume complete control over the representation of each number.


<p>
The type <em>string</em> represents immutable sequences of bytes.

Acorn is 8-bit clean:
strings can contain any 8-bit value,
including embedded zeros ('<code>\0</code>').
Acorn is also encoding-agnostic;
it makes no assumptions about the contents of a string.
The length of any string in Acorn must fit in a Acorn integer.


<p>
Acorn can call (and manipulate) functions written in Acorn and
functions written in C (see <a href="#3.4.10">&sect;3.4.10</a>).
Both are represented by the type <em>function</em>.


<p>
The type <em>userdata</em> is provided to allow arbitrary C&nbsp;data to
be stored in Acorn variables.
A userdata value represents a block of raw memory.
There are two kinds of userdata:
<em>full userdata</em>,
which is an object with a block of memory managed by Acorn,
and <em>light userdata</em>,
which is simply a C&nbsp;pointer value.
Userdata has no predefined operations in Acorn,
except assignment and identity test.
By using <em>metatables</em>,
the programmer can define operations for full userdata values
(see <a href="#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>).
Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Acorn,
only through the C&nbsp;API.
This guarantees the integrity of data owned by
the host program and C&nbsp;libraries.


<p>
The type <em>thread</em> represents independent threads of execution
and it is used to implement coroutines (see <a href="#2.6">&sect;2.6</a>).
Acorn threads are not related to operating-system threads.
Acorn supports coroutines on all systems,
even those that do not support threads natively.


<p>
The type <em>table</em> implements associative arrays,
that is, arrays that can have as indices not only numbers,
but any Acorn value except <b>nil</b> and NaN.
(<em>Not a Number</em> is a special floating-point value
used by the IEEE 754 standard to represent
undefined numerical results, such as <code>0/0</code>.)
Tables can be <em>heterogeneous</em>;
that is, they can contain values of all types (except <b>nil</b>).
Any key associated to the value <b>nil</b> is not considered part of the table.
Conversely, any key that is not part of a table has
an associated value <b>nil</b>.


<p>
Tables are the sole data-structuring mechanism in Acorn;
they can be used to represent ordinary arrays, lists,
symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.
To represent records, Acorn uses the field name as an index.
The language supports this representation by
providing <code>a.name</code> as syntactic sugar for <code>a["name"]</code>.
There are several convenient ways to create tables in Acorn
(see <a href="#3.4.9">&sect;3.4.9</a>).


<p>
Like indices,
the values of table fields can be of any type.
In particular,
because functions are first-class values,
table fields can contain functions.
Thus tables can also carry <em>methods</em> (see <a href="#3.4.11">&sect;3.4.11</a>).


<p>
The indexing of tables follows
the definition of raw equality in the language.
The expressions <code>a[i]</code> and <code>a[j]</code>
denote the same table element
if and only if <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> are raw equal
(that is, equal without metamethods).
In particular, floats with integral values
are equal to their respective integers
(e.g., <code>1.0 == 1</code>).
To avoid ambiguities,
any float used as a key that is equal to an integer
is converted to that integer.
For instance, if you write <code>a[2.0] = true</code>,
the actual key inserted into the table will be the integer <code>2</code>.


<p>
Tables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are <em>objects</em>:
variables do not actually <em>contain</em> these values,
only <em>references</em> to them.
Assignment, parameter passing, and function returns
always manipulate references to such values;
these operations do not imply any kind of copy.


<p>
The library function <a href="#pdf-type"><code>type</code></a> returns a string describing the type
of a given value (see <a href="#pdf-type"><code>type</code></a>).





<h2>2.2 &nacorn; <a name="2.2">Environments and the Global Environment</a></h2>

<p>
As we will discuss further in <a href="#3.2">&sect;3.2</a> and <a href="#3.3.3">&sect;3.3.3</a>,
any reference to a free name
(that is, a name not bound to any declaration) <code>var</code>
is syntactically translated to <code>_ENV.var</code>.
Moreover, every chunk is compiled in the scope of
an external local variable named <code>_ENV</code> (see <a href="#3.3.2">&sect;3.3.2</a>),
so <code>_ENV</code> itself is never a free name in a chunk.


<p>
Despite the existence of this external <code>_ENV</code> variable and
the translation of free names,
<code>_ENV</code> is a completely regular name.
In particular,
you can define new variables and parameters with that name.
Each reference to a free name uses the <code>_ENV</code> that is
visible at that point in the program,
following the usual visibility rules of Acorn (see <a href="#3.5">&sect;3.5</a>).


<p>
Any table used as the value of <code>_ENV</code> is called an <em>environment</em>.


<p>
Acorn keeps a distinguished environment called the <em>global environment</em>.
This value is kept at a special index in the C registry (see <a href="#4.3">&sect;4.3</a>).
In Acorn, the global variable <a href="#pdf-_G"><code>_G</code></a> is initialized with this same value.
(<a href="#pdf-_G"><code>_G</code></a> is never used internally,
so changing its value will affect only your own code.)


<p>
When Acorn loads a chunk,
the default value for its <code>_ENV</code> variable
is the global environment (see <a href="#pdf-load"><code>load</code></a>).
Therefore, by default,
free names in Acorn code refer to entries in the global environment
and, therefore, they are also called <em>global variables</em>.
Moreover, all standard libraries are loaded in the global environment
and some functions there operate on that environment.
You can use <a href="#pdf-load"><code>load</code></a> (or <a href="#pdf-loadfile"><code>loadfile</code></a>)
to load a chunk with a different environment.
(In C, you have to load the chunk and then change the value
of its first upvalue; see <a href="#acorn_setupvalue"><code>acorn_setupvalue</code></a>.)





<h2>2.3 &nacorn; <a name="2.3">Error Handling</a></h2>

<p>
Several operations in Acorn can <em>raise</em> an error.
An error interrupts the normal flow of the program,
which can continue by <em>catching</em> the error.


<p>
Acorn code can explicitly raise an error by calling the
<a href="#pdf-error"><code>error</code></a> function.
(This function never returns.)


<p>
To catch errors in Acorn,
you can do a <em>protected call</em>,
using <a href="#pdf-pcall"><code>pcall</code></a> (or <a href="#pdf-xpcall"><code>xpcall</code></a>).
The function <a href="#pdf-pcall"><code>pcall</code></a> calls a given function in <em>protected mode</em>.
Any error while running the function stops its execution,
and control returns immediately to <code>pcall</code>,
which returns a status code.


<p>
Because Acorn is an embedded extension language,
Acorn code starts running by a call
from C&nbsp;code in the host program.
(When you use Acorn standalone,
the <code>acorn</code> application is the host program.)
Usually, this call is protected;
so, when an otherwise unprotected error occurs during
the compilation or execution of a Acorn chunk,
control returns to the host,
which can take appropriate measures,
such as printing an error message.


<p>
Whenever there is an error,
an <em>error object</em>
is propagated with information about the error.
Acorn itself only generates errors whose error object is a string,
but programs may generate errors with
any value as the error object.
It is up to the Acorn program or its host to handle such error objects.
For historical reasons,
an error object is often called an <em>error message</em>,
even though it does not have to be a string.


<p>
When you use <a href="#pdf-xpcall"><code>xpcall</code></a> (or <a href="#acorn_pcall"><code>acorn_pcall</code></a>, in C)
you may give a <em>message handler</em>
to be called in case of errors.
This function is called with the original error object
and returns a new error object.
It is called before the error unwinds the stack,
so that it can gather more information about the error,
for instance by inspecting the stack and creating a stack traceback.
This message handler is still protected by the protected call;
so, an error inside the message handler
will call the message handler again.
If this loop Acornes on for too long,
Acorn breaks it and returns an appropriate message.
The message handler is called only for regular runtime errors.
It is not called for memory-allocation errors
nor for errors while running finalizers or other message handlers.


<p>
Acorn also offers a system of <em>warnings</em> (see <a href="#pdf-warn"><code>warn</code></a>).
Unlike errors, warnings do not interfere
in any way with program execution.
They typically only generate a message to the user,
although this behavior can be adapted from C (see <a href="#acorn_setwarnf"><code>acorn_setwarnf</code></a>).





<h2>2.4 &nacorn; <a name="2.4">Metatables and Metamethods</a></h2>

<p>
Every value in Acorn can have a <em>metatable</em>.
This <em>metatable</em> is an ordinary Acorn table
that defines the behavior of the original value
under certain events.
You can change several aspects of the behavior
of a value by setting specific fields in its metatable.
For instance, when a non-numeric value is the operand of an addition,
Acorn checks for a function in the field <code>__add</code> of the value's metatable.
If it finds one,
Acorn calls this function to perform the addition.


<p>
The key for each event in a metatable is a string
with the event name prefixed by two underscores;
the corresponding value is called a <em>metavalue</em>.
For most events, the metavalue must be a function,
which is then called a <em>metamethod</em>.
In the previous example, the key is the string "<code>__add</code>"
and the metamethod is the function that performs the addition.
Unless stated otherwise,
a metamethod may in fact be any callable value,
which is either a function or a value with a <code>__call</code> metamethod.


<p>
You can query the metatable of any value
using the <a href="#pdf-getmetatable"><code>getmetatable</code></a> function.
Acorn queries metamethods in metatables using a raw access (see <a href="#pdf-rawget"><code>rawget</code></a>).


<p>
You can replace the metatable of tables
using the <a href="#pdf-setmetatable"><code>setmetatable</code></a> function.
You cannot change the metatable of other types from Acorn code,
except by using the debug library (<a href="#6.10">&sect;6.10</a>).


<p>
Tables and full userdata have individual metatables,
although multiple tables and userdata can share their metatables.
Values of all other types share one single metatable per type;
that is, there is one single metatable for all numbers,
one for all strings, etc.
By default, a value has no metatable,
but the string library sets a metatable for the string type (see <a href="#6.4">&sect;6.4</a>).


<p>
A detailed list of operations controlled by metatables is given next.
Each event is identified by its corresponding key.
By convention, all metatable keys used by Acorn are composed by
two underscores followed by lowercase Latin letters.



<ul>

<li><b><code>__add</code>: </b>
the addition (<code>+</code>) operation.
If any operand for an addition is not a number,
Acorn will try to call a metamethod.
It starts by checking the first operand (even if it is a number);
if that operand does not define a metamethod for <code>__add</code>,
then Acorn will check the second operand.
If Acorn can find a metamethod,
it calls the metamethod with the two operands as arguments,
and the result of the call
(adjusted to one value)
is the result of the operation.
Otherwise, if no metamethod is found,
Acorn raises an error.
</li>

<li><b><code>__sub</code>: </b>
the subtraction (<code>-</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__mul</code>: </b>
the multiplication (<code>*</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__div</code>: </b>
the division (<code>/</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__mod</code>: </b>
the modulo (<code>%</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__pow</code>: </b>
the exponentiation (<code>^</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__unm</code>: </b>
the negation (unary <code>-</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__idiv</code>: </b>
the floor division (<code>//</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__band</code>: </b>
the bitwise AND (<code>&amp;</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation,
except that Acorn will try a metamethod
if any operand is neither an integer
nor a float coercible to an integer (see <a href="#3.4.3">&sect;3.4.3</a>).
</li>

<li><b><code>__bor</code>: </b>
the bitwise OR (<code>|</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the bitwise AND operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__bxor</code>: </b>
the bitwise exclusive OR (binary <code>~</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the bitwise AND operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__bnot</code>: </b>
the bitwise NOT (unary <code>~</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the bitwise AND operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__shl</code>: </b>
the bitwise left shift (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the bitwise AND operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__shr</code>: </b>
the bitwise right shift (<code>&gt;&gt;</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the bitwise AND operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__concat</code>: </b>
the concatenation (<code>..</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation,
except that Acorn will try a metamethod
if any operand is neither a string nor a number
(which is always coercible to a string).
</li>

<li><b><code>__len</code>: </b>
the length (<code>#</code>) operation.
If the object is not a string,
Acorn will try its metamethod.
If there is a metamethod,
Acorn calls it with the object as argument,
and the result of the call
(always adjusted to one value)
is the result of the operation.
If there is no metamethod but the object is a table,
then Acorn uses the table length operation (see <a href="#3.4.7">&sect;3.4.7</a>).
Otherwise, Acorn raises an error.
</li>

<li><b><code>__eq</code>: </b>
the equal (<code>==</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation,
except that Acorn will try a metamethod only when the values
being compared are either both tables or both full userdata
and they are not primitively equal.
The result of the call is always converted to a boolean.
</li>

<li><b><code>__lt</code>: </b>
the less than (<code>&lt;</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the addition operation,
except that Acorn will try a metamethod only when the values
being compared are neither both numbers nor both strings.
Moreover, the result of the call is always converted to a boolean.
</li>

<li><b><code>__le</code>: </b>
the less equal (<code>&lt;=</code>) operation.
Behavior similar to the less than operation.
</li>

<li><b><code>__index</code>: </b>
The indexing access operation <code>table[key]</code>.
This event happens when <code>table</code> is not a table or
when <code>key</code> is not present in <code>table</code>.
The metavalue is looked up in the metatable of <code>table</code>.


<p>
The metavalue for this event can be either a function, a table,
or any value with an <code>__index</code> metavalue.
If it is a function,
it is called with <code>table</code> and <code>key</code> as arguments,
and the result of the call
(adjusted to one value)
is the result of the operation.
Otherwise,
the final result is the result of indexing this metavalue with <code>key</code>.
This indexing is regular, not raw,
and therefore can trigger another <code>__index</code> metavalue.
</li>

<li><b><code>__newindex</code>: </b>
The indexing assignment <code>table[key] = value</code>.
Like the index event,
this event happens when <code>table</code> is not a table or
when <code>key</code> is not present in <code>table</code>.
The metavalue is looked up in the metatable of <code>table</code>.


<p>
Like with indexing,
the metavalue for this event can be either a function, a table,
or any value with an <code>__newindex</code> metavalue.
If it is a function,
it is called with <code>table</code>, <code>key</code>, and <code>value</code> as arguments.
Otherwise,
Acorn repeats the indexing assignment over this metavalue
with the same key and value.
This assignment is regular, not raw,
and therefore can trigger another <code>__newindex</code> metavalue.


<p>
Whenever a <code>__newindex</code> metavalue is invoked,
Acorn does not perform the primitive assignment.
If needed,
the metamethod itself can call <a href="#pdf-rawset"><code>rawset</code></a>
to do the assignment.
</li>

<li><b><code>__call</code>: </b>
The call operation <code>func(args)</code>.
This event happens when Acorn tries to call a non-function value
(that is, <code>func</code> is not a function).
The metamethod is looked up in <code>func</code>.
If present,
the metamethod is called with <code>func</code> as its first argument,
followed by the arguments of the original call (<code>args</code>).
All results of the call
are the results of the operation.
This is the only metamethod that allows multiple results.
</li>

</ul>

<p>
In addition to the previous list,
the interpreter also respects the following keys in metatables:
<code>__gc</code> (see <a href="#2.5.3">&sect;2.5.3</a>),
<code>__close</code> (see <a href="#3.3.8">&sect;3.3.8</a>),
<code>__mode</code> (see <a href="#2.5.4">&sect;2.5.4</a>),
and <code>__name</code>.
(The entry <code>__name</code>,
when it contains a string,
may be used by <a href="#pdf-tostring"><code>tostring</code></a> and in error messages.)


<p>
For the unary operators (negation, length, and bitwise NOT),
the metamethod is computed and called with a dummy second operand,
equal to the first one.
This extra operand is only to simplify Acorn's internals
(by making these operators behave like a binary operation)
and may be removed in future versions.
For most uses this extra operand is irrelevant.


<p>
Because metatables are regular tables,
they can contain arbitrary fields,
not only the event names defined above.
Some functions in the standard library
(e.g., <a href="#pdf-tostring"><code>tostring</code></a>)
use other fields in metatables for their own purposes.


<p>
It is a Acornod practice to add all needed metamethods to a table
before setting it as a metatable of some object.
In particular, the <code>__gc</code> metamethod works only when this order
is followed (see <a href="#2.5.3">&sect;2.5.3</a>).
It is also a Acornod practice to set the metatable of an object
right after its creation.





<h2>2.5 &nacorn; <a name="2.5">Garbage Collection</a></h2>



<p>
Acorn performs automatic memory management.
This means that
you do not have to worry about allocating memory for new objects
or freeing it when the objects are no longer needed.
Acorn manages memory automatically by running
a <em>garbage collector</em> to collect all <em>dead</em> objects.
All memory used by Acorn is subject to automatic management:
strings, tables, userdata, functions, threads, internal structures, etc.


<p>
An object is considered <em>dead</em>
as soon as the collector can be sure the object
will not be accessed again in the normal execution of the program.
("Normal execution" here excludes finalizers,
which can resurrect dead objects (see <a href="#2.5.3">&sect;2.5.3</a>),
and excludes also operations using the debug library.)
Note that the time when the collector can be sure that an object
is dead may not coincide with the programmer's expectations.
The only guarantees are that Acorn will not collect an object
that may still be accessed in the normal execution of the program,
and it will eventually collect an object
that is inaccessible from Acorn.
(Here,
<em>inaccessible from Acorn</em> means that neither a variable nor
another live object refer to the object.)
Because Acorn has no knowledge about C&nbsp;code,
it never collects objects accessible through the registry (see <a href="#4.3">&sect;4.3</a>),
which includes the global environment (see <a href="#2.2">&sect;2.2</a>).


<p>
The garbage collector (GC) in Acorn can work in two modes:
incremental and generational.


<p>
The default GC mode with the default parameters
are adequate for most uses.
However, programs that waste a large proportion of their time
allocating and freeing memory can benefit from other settings.
Keep in mind that the GC behavior is non-portable
both across platforms and across different Acorn releases;
therefore, optimal settings are also non-portable.


<p>
You can change the GC mode and parameters by calling
<a href="#acorn_gc"><code>acorn_gc</code></a> in&nbsp;C
or <a href="#pdf-collectgarbage"><code>collectgarbage</code></a> in Acorn.
You can also use these functions to control
the collector directly (e.g., to stop and restart it).





<h3>2.5.1 &nacorn; <a name="2.5.1">Incremental Garbage Collection</a></h3>

<p>
In incremental mode,
each GC cycle performs a mark-and-sweep collection in small steps
interleaved with the program's execution.
In this mode,
the collector uses three numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles:
the <em>garbage-collector pause</em>,
the <em>garbage-collector step multiplier</em>,
and the <em>garbage-collector step size</em>.


<p>
The garbage-collector pause
controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle.
The collector starts a new cycle when the use of memory
hits <em>n%</em> of the use after the previous collection.
Larger values make the collector less aggressive.
Values equal to or less than 100 mean the collector will not wait to
start a new cycle.
A value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use
to double before starting a new cycle.
The default value is 200; the maximum value is 1000.


<p>
The garbage-collector step multiplier
controls the speed of the collector relative to
memory allocation,
that is,
how many elements it marks or sweeps for each
kilobyte of memory allocated.
Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also increase
the size of each incremental step.
You should not use values less than 100,
because they make the collector too slow and
can result in the collector never finishing a cycle.
The default value is 100;  the maximum value is 1000.


<p>
The garbage-collector step size controls the
size of each incremental step,
specifically how many bytes the interpreter allocates
before performing a step.
This parameter is logarithmic:
A value of <em>n</em> means the interpreter will allocate <em>2<sup>n</sup></em>
bytes between steps and perform equivalent work during the step.
A large value (e.g., 60) makes the collector a stop-the-world
(non-incremental) collector.
The default value is 13,
which means steps of approximately 8&nbsp;Kbytes.





<h3>2.5.2 &nacorn; <a name="2.5.2">Generational Garbage Collection</a></h3>

<p>
In generational mode,
the collector does frequent <em>minor</em> collections,
which traverses only objects recently created.
If after a minor collection the use of memory is still above a limit,
the collector does a stop-the-world <em>major</em> collection,
which traverses all objects.
The generational mode uses two parameters:
the <em>minor multiplier</em> and the <em>the major multiplier</em>.


<p>
The minor multiplier controls the frequency of minor collections.
For a minor multiplier <em>x</em>,
a new minor collection will be done when memory
grows <em>x%</em> larger than the memory in use after the previous major
collection.
For instance, for a multiplier of 20,
the collector will do a minor collection when the use of memory
gets 20% larger than the use after the previous major collection.
The default value is 20; the maximum value is 200.


<p>
The major multiplier controls the frequency of major collections.
For a major multiplier <em>x</em>,
a new major collection will be done when memory
grows <em>x%</em> larger than the memory in use after the previous major
collection.
For instance, for a multiplier of 100,
the collector will do a major collection when the use of memory
gets larger than twice the use after the previous collection.
The default value is 100; the maximum value is 1000.





<h3>2.5.3 &nacorn; <a name="2.5.3">Garbage-Collection Metamethods</a></h3>

<p>
You can set garbage-collector metamethods for tables
and, using the C&nbsp;API,
for full userdata (see <a href="#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>).
These metamethods, called <em>finalizers</em>,
are called when the garbage collector detects that the
corresponding table or userdata is dead.
Finalizers allow you to coordinate Acorn's garbage collection
with external resource management such as closing files,
network or database connections,
or freeing your own memory.


<p>
For an object (table or userdata) to be finalized when collected,
you must <em>mark</em> it for finalization.

You mark an object for finalization when you set its metatable
and the metatable has a <code>__gc</code> metamethod.
Note that if you set a metatable without a <code>__gc</code> field
and later create that field in the metatable,
the object will not be marked for finalization.


<p>
When a marked object becomes dead,
it is not collected immediately by the garbage collector.
Instead, Acorn puts it in a list.
After the collection,
Acorn Acornes through that list.
For each object in the list,
it checks the object's <code>__gc</code> metamethod:
If it is present,
Acorn calls it with the object as its single argument.


<p>
At the end of each garbage-collection cycle,
the finalizers are called in
the reverse order that the objects were marked for finalization,
among those collected in that cycle;
that is, the first finalizer to be called is the one associated
with the object marked last in the program.
The execution of each finalizer may occur at any point during
the execution of the regular code.


<p>
Because the object being collected must still be used by the finalizer,
that object (and other objects accessible only through it)
must be <em>resurrected</em> by Acorn.
Usually, this resurrection is transient,
and the object memory is freed in the next garbage-collection cycle.
However, if the finalizer stores the object in some global place
(e.g., a global variable),
then the resurrection is permanent.
Moreover, if the finalizer marks a finalizing object for finalization again,
its finalizer will be called again in the next cycle where the
object is dead.
In any case,
the object memory is freed only in a GC cycle where
the object is dead and not marked for finalization.


<p>
When you close a state (see <a href="#acorn_close"><code>acorn_close</code></a>),
Acorn calls the finalizers of all objects marked for finalization,
following the reverse order that they were marked.
If any finalizer marks objects for collection during that phase,
these marks have no effect.


<p>
Finalizers cannot yield nor run the garbage collector.
Because they can run in unpredictable times,
it is Acornod practice to restrict each finalizer
to the minimum necessary to properly release
its associated resource.


<p>
Any error while running a finalizer generates a warning;
the error is not propagated.





<h3>2.5.4 &nacorn; <a name="2.5.4">Weak Tables</a></h3>

<p>
A <em>weak table</em> is a table whose elements are
<em>weak references</em>.
A weak reference is ignored by the garbage collector.
In other words,
if the only references to an object are weak references,
then the garbage collector will collect that object.


<p>
A weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both.
A table with weak values allows the collection of its values,
but prevents the collection of its keys.
A table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of
both keys and values.
In any case, if either the key or the value is collected,
the whole pair is removed from the table.
The weakness of a table is controlled by the
<code>__mode</code> field of its metatable.
This metavalue, if present, must be one of the following strings:
"<code>k</code>", for a table with weak keys;
"<code>v</code>", for a table with weak values;
or "<code>kv</code>", for a table with both weak keys and values.


<p>
A table with weak keys and strong values
is also called an <em>ephemeron table</em>.
In an ephemeron table,
a value is considered reachable only if its key is reachable.
In particular,
if the only reference to a key comes through its value,
the pair is removed.


<p>
Any change in the weakness of a table may take effect only
at the next collect cycle.
In particular, if you change the weakness to a stronger mode,
Acorn may still collect some items from that table
before the change takes effect.


<p>
Only objects that have an explicit construction
are removed from weak tables.
Values, such as numbers and light C&nbsp;functions,
are not subject to garbage collection,
and therefore are not removed from weak tables
(unless their associated values are collected).
Although strings are subject to garbage collection,
they do not have an explicit construction and
their equality is by value;
they behave more like values than like objects.
Therefore, they are not removed from weak tables.


<p>
Resurrected objects
(that is, objects being finalized
and objects accessible only through objects being finalized)
have a special behavior in weak tables.
They are removed from weak values before running their finalizers,
but are removed from weak keys only in the next collection
after running their finalizers, when such objects are actually freed.
This behavior allows the finalizer to access properties
associated with the object through weak tables.


<p>
If a weak table is among the resurrected objects in a collection cycle,
it may not be properly cleared until the next cycle.







<h2>2.6 &nacorn; <a name="2.6">Coroutines</a></h2>

<p>
Acorn supports coroutines,
also called <em>collaborative multithreading</em>.
A coroutine in Acorn represents an independent thread of execution.
Unlike threads in multithread systems, however,
a coroutine only suspends its execution by explicitly calling
a yield function.


<p>
You create a coroutine by calling <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>.
Its sole argument is a function
that is the main function of the coroutine.
The <code>create</code> function only creates a new coroutine and
returns a handle to it (an object of type <em>thread</em>);
it does not start the coroutine.


<p>
You execute a coroutine by calling <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>.
When you first call <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
passing as its first argument
a thread returned by <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>,
the coroutine starts its execution by
calling its main function.
Extra arguments passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> are passed
as arguments to that function.
After the coroutine starts running,
it runs until it terminates or <em>yields</em>.


<p>
A coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways:
normally, when its main function returns
(explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction);
and abnormally, if there is an unprotected error.
In case of normal termination,
<a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns <b>true</b>,
plus any values returned by the coroutine main function.
In case of errors, <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns <b>false</b>
plus the error object.
In this case, the coroutine does not unwind its stack,
so that it is possible to inspect it after the error
with the debug API.


<p>
A coroutine yields by calling <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a>.
When a coroutine yields,
the corresponding <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns immediately,
even if the yield happens inside nested function calls
(that is, not in the main function,
but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main function).
In the case of a yield, <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> also returns <b>true</b>,
plus any values passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a>.
The next time you resume the same coroutine,
it continues its execution from the point where it yielded,
with the call to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a> returning any extra
arguments passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>.


<p>
Like <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>,
the <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a> function also creates a coroutine,
but instead of returning the coroutine itself,
it returns a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine.
Any arguments passed to this function
Acorn as extra arguments to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>.
<a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a> returns all the values returned by <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
except the first one (the boolean error code).
Unlike <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
the function created by <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a>
propagates any error to the caller.
In this case,
the function also closes the coroutine (see <a href="#pdf-coroutine.close"><code>coroutine.close</code></a>).


<p>
As an example of how coroutines work,
consider the following code:

<pre>
     function foo (a)
       print("foo", a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end
     
     co = coroutine.create(function (a,b)
           print("co-body", a, b)
           local r = foo(a+1)
           print("co-body", r)
           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print("co-body", r, s)
           return b, "end"
     end)
     
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "r"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
</pre><p>
When you run it, it produces the following output:

<pre>
     co-body 1       10
     foo     2
     main    true    4
     co-body r
     main    true    11      -9
     co-body x       y
     main    true    10      end
     main    false   cannot resume dead coroutine
</pre>

<p>
You can also create and manipulate coroutines through the C API:
see functions <a href="#acorn_newthread"><code>acorn_newthread</code></a>, <a href="#acorn_resume"><code>acorn_resume</code></a>,
and <a href="#acorn_yield"><code>acorn_yield</code></a>.





<h1>3 &nacorn; <a name="3">The Language</a></h1>



<p>
This section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Acorn.
In other words,
this section describes
which tokens are valid,
how they can be combined,
and what their combinations mean.


<p>
Language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BNF notation,
in which
{<em>a</em>}&nbsp;means&nbsp;0 or more <em>a</em>'s, and
[<em>a</em>]&nbsp;means an optional <em>a</em>.
Non-terminals are shown like non-terminal,
keywords are shown like <b>kword</b>,
and other terminal symbols are shown like &lsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo;.
The complete syntax of Acorn can be found in <a href="#9">&sect;9</a>
at the end of this manual.





<h2>3.1 &nacorn; <a name="3.1">Lexical Conventions</a></h2>

<p>
Acorn is a free-form language.
It ignores spaces and comments between lexical elements (tokens),
except as delimiters between two tokens.
In source code,
Acorn recognizes as spaces the standard ASCII whitespace
characters space, form feed, newline,
carriage return, horizontal tab, and vertical tab.


<p>
<em>Names</em>
(also called <em>identifiers</em>)
in Acorn can be any string of Latin letters,
Arabic-Indic digits, and underscores,
not beginning with a digit and
not being a reserved word.
Identifiers are used to name variables, table fields, and labels.


<p>
The following <em>keywords</em> are reserved
and cannot be used as names:


<pre>
     and       break     do        else      elseif    end
     false     for       function  goto      if        in
     local     nil       not       or        repeat    return
     then      true      until     while
</pre>

<p>
Acorn is a case-sensitive language:
<code>and</code> is a reserved word, but <code>And</code> and <code>AND</code>
are two different, valid names.
As a convention,
programs should avoid creating
names that start with an underscore followed by
one or more uppercase letters (such as <a href="#pdf-_VERSION"><code>_VERSION</code></a>).


<p>
The following strings denote other tokens:

<pre>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     &amp;     ~     |     &lt;&lt;    &gt;&gt;    //
     ==    ~=    &lt;=    &gt;=    &lt;     &gt;     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]     ::
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
</pre>

<p>
A <em>short literal string</em>
can be delimited by matching single or double quotes,
and can contain the following C-like escape sequences:
'<code>\a</code>' (bell),
'<code>\b</code>' (backspace),
'<code>\f</code>' (form feed),
'<code>\n</code>' (newline),
'<code>\r</code>' (carriage return),
'<code>\t</code>' (horizontal tab),
'<code>\v</code>' (vertical tab),
'<code>\\</code>' (backslash),
'<code>\"</code>' (quotation mark [double quote]),
and '<code>\'</code>' (apostrophe [single quote]).
A backslash followed by a line break
results in a newline in the string.
The escape sequence '<code>\z</code>' skips the following span
of whitespace characters,
including line breaks;
it is particularly useful to break and indent a long literal string
into multiple lines without adding the newlines and spaces
into the string contents.
A short literal string cannot contain unescaped line breaks
nor escapes not forming a valid escape sequence.


<p>
We can specify any byte in a short literal string,
including embedded zeros,
by its numeric value.
This can be done
with the escape sequence <code>\x<em>XX</em></code>,
where <em>XX</em> is a sequence of exactly two hexadecimal digits,
or with the escape sequence <code>\<em>ddd</em></code>,
where <em>ddd</em> is a sequence of up to three decimal digits.
(Note that if a decimal escape sequence is to be followed by a digit,
it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)


<p>
The UTF-8 encoding of a Unicode character
can be inserted in a literal string with
the escape sequence <code>\u{<em>XXX</em>}</code>
(with mandatory enclosing braces),
where <em>XXX</em> is a sequence of one or more hexadecimal digits
representing the character code point.
This code point can be any value less than <em>2<sup>31</sup></em>.
(Acorn uses the original UTF-8 specification here,
which is not restricted to valid Unicode code points.)


<p>
Literal strings can also be defined using a long format
enclosed by <em>long brackets</em>.
We define an <em>opening long bracket of level <em>n</em></em> as an opening
square bracket followed by <em>n</em> equal signs followed by another
opening square bracket.
So, an opening long bracket of level&nbsp;0 is written as <code>[[</code>, 
an opening long bracket of level&nbsp;1 is written as <code>[=[</code>, 
and so on.
A <em>closing long bracket</em> is defined similarly;
for instance,
a closing long bracket of level&nbsp;4 is written as  <code>]====]</code>.
A <em>long literal</em> starts with an opening long bracket of any level and
ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level.
It can contain any text except a closing bracket of the same level.
Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines,
do not interpret any escape sequences,
and ignore long brackets of any other level.
Any kind of end-of-line sequence
(carriage return, newline, carriage return followed by newline,
or newline followed by carriage return)
is converted to a simple newline.
When the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline,
the newline is not included in the string.


<p>
As an example, in a system using ASCII
(in which '<code>a</code>' is coded as&nbsp;97,
newline is coded as&nbsp;10, and '<code>1</code>' is coded as&nbsp;49),
the five literal strings below denote the same string:

<pre>
     a = 'alo\n123"'
     a = "alo\n123\""
     a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
     a = [[alo
     123"]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123"]==]
</pre>

<p>
Any byte in a literal string not
explicitly affected by the previous rules represents itself.
However, Acorn opens files for parsing in text mode,
and the system's file functions may have problems with
some control characters.
So, it is safer to represent
binary data as a quoted literal with
explicit escape sequences for the non-text characters.


<p>
A <em>numeric constant</em> (or <em>numeral</em>)
can be written with an optional fractional part
and an optional decimal exponent,
marked by a letter '<code>e</code>' or '<code>E</code>'.
Acorn also accepts hexadecimal constants,
which start with <code>0x</code> or <code>0X</code>.
Hexadecimal constants also accept an optional fractional part
plus an optional binary exponent,
marked by a letter '<code>p</code>' or '<code>P</code>'.


<p>
A numeric constant with a radix point or an exponent
denotes a float;
otherwise,
if its value fits in an integer or it is a hexadecimal constant,
it denotes an integer;
otherwise (that is, a decimal integer numeral that overflows),
it denotes a float.
Hexadecimal numerals with neither a radix point nor an exponent
always denote an integer value;
if the value overflows, it <em>wraps around</em>
to fit into a valid integer.


<p>
Examples of valid integer constants are

<pre>
     3   345   0xff   0xBEBADA
</pre><p>
Examples of valid float constants are

<pre>
     3.0     3.1416     314.16e-2     0.31416E1     34e1
     0x0.1E  0xA23p-4   0X1.921FB54442D18P+1
</pre>

<p>
A <em>comment</em> starts with a double hyphen (<code>--</code>)
anywhere outside a string.
If the text immediately after <code>--</code> is not an opening long bracket,
the comment is a <em>short comment</em>,
which runs until the end of the line.
Otherwise, it is a <em>long comment</em>,
which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket.





<h2>3.2 &nacorn; <a name="3.2">Variables</a></h2>

<p>
Variables are places that store values.
There are three kinds of variables in Acorn:
global variables, local variables, and table fields.


<p>
A single name can denote a global variable or a local variable
(or a function's formal parameter,
which is a particular kind of local variable):

<pre>
	var ::= Name
</pre><p>
Name denotes identifiers (see <a href="#3.1">&sect;3.1</a>).


<p>
Any variable name is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared
as a local (see <a href="#3.3.7">&sect;3.3.7</a>).
Local variables are <em>lexically scoped</em>:
local variables can be freely accessed by functions
defined inside their scope (see <a href="#3.5">&sect;3.5</a>).


<p>
Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is <b>nil</b>.


<p>
Square brackets are used to index a table:

<pre>
	var ::= prefixexp &lsquo;<b>[</b>&rsquo; exp &lsquo;<b>]</b>&rsquo;
</pre><p>
The meaning of accesses to table fields can be changed via metatables
(see <a href="#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>).


<p>
The syntax <code>var.Name</code> is just syntactic sugar for
<code>var["Name"]</code>:

<pre>
	var ::= prefixexp &lsquo;<b>.</b>&rsquo; Name
</pre>

<p>
An access to a global variable <code>x</code>
is equivalent to <code>_ENV.x</code>.
Due to the way that chunks are compiled,
the variable <code>_ENV</code> itself is never global (see <a href="#2.2">&sect;2.2</a>).





<h2>3.3 &nacorn; <a name="3.3">Statements</a></h2>



<p>
Acorn supports an almost conventional set of statements,
similar to those in other conventional languages.
This set includes
blocks, assignments, control structures, function calls,
and variable declarations.





<h3>3.3.1 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.1">Blocks</a></h3>

<p>
A block is a list of statements,
which are executed sequentially:

<pre>
	block ::= {stat}
</pre><p>
Acorn has <em>empty statements</em>
that allow you to separate statements with semicolons,
start a block with a semicolon
or write two semicolons in sequence:

<pre>
	stat ::= &lsquo;<b>;</b>&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>
Both function calls and assignments
can start with an open parenthesis.
This possibility leads to an ambiguity in Acorn's grammar.
Consider the following fragment:

<pre>
     a = b + c
     (print or io.write)('done')
</pre><p>
The grammar could see this fragment in two ways:

<pre>
     a = b + c(print or io.write)('done')
     
     a = b + c; (print or io.write)('done')
</pre><p>
The current parser always sees such constructions
in the first way,
interpreting the open parenthesis
as the start of the arguments to a call.
To avoid this ambiguity,
it is a Acornod practice to always precede with a semicolon
statements that start with a parenthesis:

<pre>
     ;(print or io.write)('done')
</pre>

<p>
A block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:

<pre>
	stat ::= <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
</pre><p>
Explicit blocks are useful
to control the scope of variable declarations.
Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to
add a <b>return</b> statement in the middle
of another block (see <a href="#3.3.4">&sect;3.3.4</a>).





<h3>3.3.2 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.2">Chunks</a></h3>

<p>
The unit of compilation of Acorn is called a <em>chunk</em>.
Syntactically,
a chunk is simply a block:

<pre>
	chunk ::= block
</pre>

<p>
Acorn handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function
with a variable number of arguments
(see <a href="#3.4.11">&sect;3.4.11</a>).
As such, chunks can define local variables,
receive arguments, and return values.
Moreover, such anonymous function is compiled as in the
scope of an external local variable called <code>_ENV</code> (see <a href="#2.2">&sect;2.2</a>).
The resulting function always has <code>_ENV</code> as its only external variable,
even if it does not use that variable.


<p>
A chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program.
To execute a chunk,
Acorn first <em>loads</em> it,
precompiling the chunk's code into instructions for a virtual machine,
and then Acorn executes the compiled code
with an interpreter for the virtual machine.


<p>
Chunks can also be precompiled into binary form;
see the program <code>acornc</code> and the function <a href="#pdf-string.dump"><code>string.dump</code></a> for details.
Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable;
Acorn automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly (see <a href="#pdf-load"><code>load</code></a>).





<h3>3.3.3 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.3">Assignment</a></h3>

<p>
Acorn allows multiple assignments.
Therefore, the syntax for assignment
defines a list of variables on the left side
and a list of expressions on the right side.
The elements in both lists are separated by commas:

<pre>
	stat ::= varlist &lsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; explist
	varlist ::= var {&lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; var}
	explist ::= exp {&lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; exp}
</pre><p>
Expressions are discussed in <a href="#3.4">&sect;3.4</a>.


<p>
Before the assignment,
the list of values is <em>adjusted</em> to the length of
the list of variables.
If there are more values than needed,
the excess values are thrown away.
If there are fewer values than needed,
the list is extended with <b>nil</b>'s.
If the list of expressions ends with a function call,
then all values returned by that call enter the list of values,
before the adjustment
(except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see <a href="#3.4">&sect;3.4</a>).


<p>
If a variable is both assigned and read
inside a multiple assignment,
Acorn ensures all reads get the value of the variable
before the assignment.
Thus the code

<pre>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
</pre><p>
sets <code>a[3]</code> to 20, without affecting <code>a[4]</code>
because the <code>i</code> in <code>a[i]</code> is evaacornted (to 3)
before it is assigned&nbsp;4.
Similarly, the line

<pre>
     x, y = y, x
</pre><p>
exchanges the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
and

<pre>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
</pre><p>
cyclically permutes the values of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.


<p>
Note that this guarantee covers only accesses
syntactically inside the assignment statement.
If a function or a metamethod called during the assignment
changes the value of a variable,
Acorn gives no guarantees about the order of that access.


<p>
An assignment to a global name <code>x = val</code>
is equivalent to the assignment
<code>_ENV.x = val</code> (see <a href="#2.2">&sect;2.2</a>).


<p>
The meaning of assignments to table fields and
global variables (which are actually table fields, too)
can be changed via metatables (see <a href="#2.4">&sect;2.4</a>).





<h3>3.3.4 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.4">Control Structures</a></h3><p>
The control structures
<b>if</b>, <b>while</b>, and <b>repeat</b> have the usual meaning and
familiar syntax:




<pre>
	stat ::= <b>while</b> exp <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
	stat ::= <b>repeat</b> block <b>until</b> exp
	stat ::= <b>if</b> exp <b>then</b> block {<b>elseif</b> exp <b>then</b> block} [<b>else</b> block] <b>end</b>
</pre><p>
Acorn also has a <b>for</b> statement, in two flavors (see <a href="#3.3.5">&sect;3.3.5</a>).


<p>
The condition expression of a
control structure can return any value.
Both <b>false</b> and <b>nil</b> test false.
All values different from <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> test true.
In particular, the number 0 and the empty string also test true.


<p>
In the <b>repeat</b>&nacorn;<b>until</b> loop,
the inner block does not end at the <b>until</b> keyword,
but only after the condition.
So, the condition can refer to local variables
declared inside the loop block.


<p>
The <b>goto</b> statement transfers the program control to a label.
For syntactical reasons,
labels in Acorn are considered statements too:



<pre>
	stat ::= <b>goto</b> Name
	stat ::= label
	label ::= &lsquo;<b>::</b>&rsquo; Name &lsquo;<b>::</b>&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>
A label is visible in the entire block where it is defined,
except inside nested functions.
A goto may jump to any visible label as long as it does not
enter into the scope of a local variable.
A label should not be declared
where a label with the same name is visible,
even if this other label has been declared in an enclosing block.


<p>
Labels and empty statements are called <em>void statements</em>,
as they perform no actions.


<p>
The <b>break</b> statement terminates the execution of a
<b>while</b>, <b>repeat</b>, or <b>for</b> loop,
skipping to the next statement after the loop:


<pre>
	stat ::= <b>break</b>
</pre><p>
A <b>break</b> ends the innermost enclosing loop.


<p>
The <b>return</b> statement is used to return values
from a function or a chunk
(which is handled as an anonymous function).

Functions can return more than one value,
so the syntax for the <b>return</b> statement is

<pre>
	stat ::= <b>return</b> [explist] [&lsquo;<b>;</b>&rsquo;]
</pre>

<p>
The <b>return</b> statement can only be written
as the last statement of a block.
If it is necessary to <b>return</b> in the middle of a block,
then an explicit inner block can be used,
as in the idiom <code>do return end</code>,
because now <b>return</b> is the last statement in its (inner) block.





<h3>3.3.5 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.5">For Statement</a></h3>

<p>

The <b>for</b> statement has two forms:
one numerical and one generic.



<h4>The numerical <b>for</b> loop</h4>

<p>
The numerical <b>for</b> loop repeats a block of code while a
control variable Acornes through an arithmetic progression.
It has the following syntax:

<pre>
	stat ::= <b>for</b> Name &lsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; exp &lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; exp [&lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; exp] <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
</pre><p>
The given identifier (Name) defines the control variable,
which is a new variable local to the loop body (<em>block</em>).


<p>
The loop starts by evaacornting once the three control expressions.
Their values are called respectively
the <em>initial value</em>, the <em>limit</em>, and the <em>step</em>.
If the step is absent, it defaults to&nbsp;1.


<p>
If both the initial value and the step are integers,
the loop is done with integers;
note that the limit may not be an integer.
Otherwise, the three values are converted to
floats and the loop is done with floats.
Beware of floating-point accuracy in this case.


<p>
After that initialization,
the loop body is repeated with the value of the control variable
Acorning through an arithmetic progression,
starting at the initial value,
with a common difference given by the step.
A negative step makes a decreasing sequence;
a step equal to zero raises an error.
The loop continues while the value is less than
or equal to the limit
(greater than or equal to for a negative step).
If the initial value is already greater than the limit
(or less than, if the step is negative),
the body is not executed.


<p>
For integer loops,
the control variable never wraps around;
instead, the loop ends in case of an overflow.


<p>
You should not change the value of the control variable
during the loop.
If you need its value after the loop,
assign it to another variable before exiting the loop.





<h4>The generic <b>for</b> loop</h4>

<p>
The generic <b>for</b> statement works over functions,
called <em>iterators</em>.
On each iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value,
stopping when this new value is <b>nil</b>.
The generic <b>for</b> loop has the following syntax:

<pre>
	stat ::= <b>for</b> namelist <b>in</b> explist <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
	namelist ::= Name {&lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; Name}
</pre><p>
A <b>for</b> statement like

<pre>
     for <em>var_1</em>, &middot;&middot;&middot;, <em>var_n</em> in <em>explist</em> do <em>body</em> end
</pre><p>
works as follows.


<p>
The names <em>var_i</em> declare loop variables local to the loop body.
The first of these variables is the <em>control variable</em>.


<p>
The loop starts by evaacornting <em>explist</em>
to produce four values:
an <em>iterator function</em>,
a <em>state</em>,
an initial value for the control variable,
and a <em>closing value</em>.


<p>
Then, at each iteration,
Acorn calls the iterator function with two arguments:
the state and the control variable.
The results from this call are then assigned to the loop variables,
following the rules of multiple assignments (see <a href="#3.3.3">&sect;3.3.3</a>).
If the control variable becomes <b>nil</b>,
the loop terminates.
Otherwise, the body is executed and the loop Acornes
to the next iteration.


<p>
The closing value behaves like a
to-be-closed variable (see <a href="#3.3.8">&sect;3.3.8</a>),
which can be used to release resources when the loop ends.
Otherwise, it does not interfere with the loop.


<p>
You should not change the value of the control variable
during the loop.







<h3>3.3.6 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.6">Function Calls as Statements</a></h3><p>
To allow possible side-effects,
function calls can be executed as statements:

<pre>
	stat ::= functioncall
</pre><p>
In this case, all returned values are thrown away.
Function calls are explained in <a href="#3.4.10">&sect;3.4.10</a>.





<h3>3.3.7 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.7">Local Declarations</a></h3><p>
Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block.
The declaration can include an initialization:

<pre>
	stat ::= <b>local</b> attnamelist [&lsquo;<b>=</b>&rsquo; explist]
	attnamelist ::=  Name attrib {&lsquo;<b>,</b>&rsquo; Name attrib}
</pre><p>
If present, an initial assignment has the same semantics
of a multiple assignment (see <a href="#3.3.3">&sect;3.3.3</a>).
Otherwise, all variables are initialized with <b>nil</b>.


<p>
Each variable name may be postfixed by an attribute
(a name between angle brackets):

<pre>
	attrib ::= [&lsquo;<b>&lt;</b>&rsquo; Name &lsquo;<b>&gt;</b>&rsquo;]
</pre><p>
There are two possible attributes:
<code>const</code>, which declares a constant variable,
that is, a variable that cannot be assigned to
after its initialization;
and <code>close</code>, which declares a to-be-closed variable (see <a href="#3.3.8">&sect;3.3.8</a>).
A list of variables can contain at most one to-be-closed variable.


<p>
A chunk is also a block (see <a href="#3.3.2">&sect;3.3.2</a>),
and so local variables can be declared in a chunk outside any explicit block.


<p>
The visibility rules for local variables are explained in <a href="#3.5">&sect;3.5</a>.





<h3>3.3.8 &nacorn; <a name="3.3.8">To-be-closed Variables</a></h3>

<p>
A to-be-closed variable behaves like a constant local variable,
except that its value is <em>closed</em> whenever the variable
Acornes out of scope, including normal block termination,
exiting its block by <b>break</b>/<b>goto</b>/<b>return</b>,
or exiting by an error.


<p>
Here, to <em>close</em> a value means
to call its <code>__close</code> metamethod.
When calling the metamethod,
the value itself is passed as the first argument
and the error object that caused the exit (if any)
is passed as a second argument;
if there was no error, the second argument is <b>nil</b>.


<p>
The value assigned to a to-be-closed variable
must have a <code>__close</code> metamethod
or be a false value.
(<b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> are ignored as to-be-closed values.)


<p>
If several to-be-closed variables Acorn out of scope at the same event,
they are closed in the reverse order that they were declared.


<p>
If there is any error while running a closing method,
that error is handled like an error in the regular code
where the variable was defined.
After an error,
the other pending closing methods will still be called.


<p>
If a coroutine yields and is never resumed again,
some variables may never Acorn out of scope,
and therefore they will never be closed.
(These variables are the ones created inside the coroutine
and in scope at the point where the coroutine yielded.)
Similarly, if a coroutine ends with an error,
it does not unwind its stack,
so it does not close any variable.
In both cases,
you can either use finalizers
or call <a href="#pdf-coroutine.close"><code>coroutine.close</code></a> to close the variables.
However, if the coroutine was created
through <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a>,
then its corresponding function will close the coroutine
in case of errors.







<h2>3.4 &nacorn; <a name="3.4">Expressions</a></h2>



<p>
The basic expressions in Acorn are the following:

<pre>
	exp ::= prefixexp
	exp ::= <b>nil</b> | <b>false</b> | <b>true</b>
	exp ::= Numeral
	exp ::= LiteralString
	exp ::= functiondef
	exp ::= tableconstructor
	exp ::= &lsquo;<b>...</b>&rsquo;
	exp ::= exp binop exp
	exp ::= unop exp
	prefixexp ::= var | functioncall | &lsquo;<b>(</b>&rsquo; exp &lsquo;<b>)</b>&rsquo;
</pre>

<p>
Numerals and literal strings are explained in <a href="#3.1">&sect;3.1</a>;
variables are explained in <a href="#3.2">&sect;3.2</a>;
function definitions are explained in <a href="#3.4.11">&sect;3.4.11</a>;
function calls are explained in <a href="#3.4.10">&sect;3.4.10</a>;
table constructors are explained in <a href="#3.4.9">&sect;3.4.9</a>.
Vararg expressions,
denoted by three dots ('<code>...</code>'), can only be used when
directly inside a vararg function;
they are explained in <a href="#3.4.11">&sect;3.4.11</a>.


<p>
Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see <a href="#3.4.1">&sect;3.4.1</a>),
bitwise operators (see <a href="#3.4.2">&sect;3.4.2</a>),
relational operators (see <a href="#3.4.4">&sect;3.4.4</a>), logical operators (see <a href="#3.4.5">&sect;3.4.5</a>),
and the concatenation operator (see <a href="#3.4.6">&sect;3.4.6</a>).
Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see <a href="#3.4.1">&sect;3.4.1</a>),
the unary bitwise NOT (see <a href="#3.4.2">&sect;3.4.2</a>),
the unary logical <b>not</b> (see <a href="#3.4.5">&sect;3.4.5</a>),
and the unary <em>length operator</em> (see <a href="#3.4.7">&sect;3.4.7</a>).


<p>
Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values.
If a function call is used as a statement (see <a href="#3.3.6">&sect;3.3.6</a>),
then its return list is adjusted to zero elements,
thus discarding all returned values.
If an expression is used as the last (or the only) element
of a list of expressions,
then no adjustment is made
(unless the expression is enclosed in parentheses).
In all other contexts,
Acorn adjusts the result list to one element,
either discarding all values except the first one
or adding a single <b>nil</b> if there are no values.


<p>
Here are some examples:

<pre>
     f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
     g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
     g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
     a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
     a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg argument, b gets
                        -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                        -- is no corresponding vararg argument)
     
     a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
     a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
     return f()         -- returns all results from f()
     return ...         -- returns all received vararg arguments
     return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
     {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
     {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg arguments
     {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
</pre>

<p>
Any expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value.
Thus,
<code>(f(x,y,z))</code> is always a single value,
even if <code>f</code> returns several values.
(The value of <code>(f(x,y,z))</code> is the first value returned by <code>f</code>
or <b>nil</b> if <code>f</code> does not return any values.)





<h3>3.4.1 &nacorn; <a name="3.4.1">Arithmetic Operators</a></h3><p>
Acorn supports the following arithmetic operators:

<ul>
<li><b><code>+</code>: </b>addition</li>
<li><b><code>-</code>: </b>subtraction</li>
<li><b><code>*</code>: </b>multiplication</li>
<li><b><code>/</code>: </b>float division</li>
<li><b><code>//</code>: </b>floor division</li>
<li><b><code>%</code>: </b>modulo</li>
<li><b><code>^</code>: </b>exponentiation</li>
<li><b><code>-</code>: </b>unary minus</li>
</ul>

<p>
With the exception of exponentiation and float division,
the arithmetic operators work as follows:
If both operands are integers,
the operation is performed over integers and the result is an integer.
Otherwise, if both operands are numbers,
then they are converted to floats,
the operation is performed following the machine's rules
for floating-point arithmetic
(usually the IEEE 754 standard),
and the result is a float.
(The string library coerces strings to numbers in
arithmetic operations; see <a href="#3.4.3">&sect;3.4.3</a> for details.)


<p>
Exponentiation and float division (<code>/</code>)
always convert their operands to floats
and the result is always a float.
Exponentiation uses the ISO&nbsp;C function <code>pow</code>,
so that it works for non-integer exponents too.


<p>
Floor division (<code>//</code>) is a division
that rounds the quotient towards minus infinity,
resulting in the floor of the division of its operands.


<p>
Modulo is defined as the remainder of a division
that rounds the quotient towards minus infinity (floor division).


<p>
In case of overflows in integer arithmetic,
all operations <em>wrap around</em>.



<h3>3.4.2 &nacorn; <a name="3.4.2">Bitwise Operators</a></h3><p>
Acorn supports the following bitwise operators:

<ul>
<li><b><code>&amp;</code>: </b>bitwise AND</li>
<li><b><code>&#124;</code>: </b>bitwise OR</li>
<li><b><code>~</code>: </b>bitwise exclusive OR</li>
<li><b><code>&gt;&gt;</code>: </b>right shift</li>
<li><b><code>&lt;&lt;</code>: </b>left shift</li>
<li><b><code>~</code>: </b>unary bitwise NOT</li>
</ul>

<p>
All bitwise operations convert its operands to integers
(see <a href="#3.4.3">&sect;3.4.3</a>),
operate on all bits of those integers,
and result in an integer.


<p>
Both right and left shifts fill the vacant bits with zeros.
Negative displacements shift to the other direction;
displacements with absolute values equal to or higher than
the number of bits in an integer
result in zero (as all bits are shifted out).





<h3>3.4.3 &nacorn; <a name="3.4.3">Coercions and Conversions</a></h3><p>
Acorn provides some automatic conversions between some
types and representations at run time.
Bitwise operators always convert float operands to integers.
Exponentiation and float division
always convert integer operands to floats.
All other arithmetic operations applied to mixed numbers
(integers and floats) convert the integer operand to a float.
The C API also converts both integers to floats and
floats to integers, as needed.
Moreover, string concatenation accepts numbers as arguments,
besides strings.


<p>
In a conversion from integer to float,
if the integer value has an exact representation as a float,
that is the result.
Otherwise,
the conversion gets the nearest higher or
the nearest lower representable value.
This kind of conversion never fails.


<p>
The conversion from float to integer
checks whether the float has an exact representation as an integer
(that is, the float has an integral value and
it is in the range of integer representation).
If it does, that representation is the result.
Otherwise, the conversion fails.


<p>
Several places in Acorn coerce strings to numbers when necessary.
In particular,
the string library sets metamethods that try to coerce
strings to numbers in all arithmetic operations.
If the conversion fails,
the library calls the metamethod of the other operand
(if present) or it raises an error.
Note that bitwise operators do not do this coercion.


<p>
Nonetheless, it is always a
