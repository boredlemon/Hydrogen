.SH NAME
cup \- Cup interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cup
[
.I options
]
[
.I script
[
.I args
]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cup
is the standalone Cup interpreter.
It loads and executes Cup programs,
either in textual source form or
in precompiled binary form.
(Precompiled binaries are output by
.BR cupc ,
the Cup compiler.)
.B cup
can be used as a batch interpreter and also interactively.
.LP
After handling the
.IR options ,
the Cup program in file
.I script
is loaded and executed.
The
.I args
are available to
.I script
as strings in a global table named
.B arg
and also as arguments to its main function.
When called without arguments,
.B cup
behaves as
.B "cup \-v \-i"
if the standard input is a terminal,
and as
.B "cup \-"
otherwise.
.LP
In interactive mode,
.B cup
prompts the user,
reads lines from the standard input,
and executes them as they are read.
If the line contains an expression,
then the line is evacupted and the result is printed.
If a line does not contain a complete statement,
then a secondary prompt is displayed and
lines are read until a complete statement is formed or
a syntax error is found.
.LP
Before handling command line options and scripts,
.B cup
checks the contents of the environment variables
.B CUP_INIT_5_4
and
.BR CUP_INIT ,
in that order.
If the contents are of the form
.RI '@ filename ',
then
.I filename
is executed.
Otherwise, the contents are assumed to be a Cup statement and is executed.
When
.B CUP_INIT_5_4
is defined,
.B CUP_INIT
is ignored.

.SH EXIT STATUS
If a script calls os.exit,
then
.B cup
exits with the given exit status.
Otherwise,
.B cup
exits
with EXIT_SUCCESS (0 on POSIX systems) if there were no errors
and
with EXIT_FAILURE (1 on POSIX systems) if there were errors.
Errors raised in interactive mode do not cause exits.
